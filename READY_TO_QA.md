- 3 users created with hashed passwords ✅
- All environment variables in Vercel ✅
- Latest code pushed to GitHub ✅
- Vercel deploying now ✅

---

## 🧪 QA Test Plan (Based on Your Requirements)

### 1. Authentication Test
- [ ] Login: shayne+1@devpipeline.com / ZBadmin123!
- [ ] Should redirect to dashboard
- [ ] Check navbar (should be single, clean)

### 2. Analysis Sequence Test (README Validation)

Based on **CORRECT_ANALYSIS_SEQUENCE.md**, proper order should be:

```
1. Content Scraping           → Raw data
2. Technical (Lighthouse)      → Performance baseline
3. SEO (Trends, Keywords)      → Search perspective
4. Language Analysis          → Value vs Benefit ratio (NEW)
5. Brand Alignment            → Stated vs Shown (NEW)
6. Golden Circle + WHO        → Universal framework
7. B2C Elements               → Consumer perspective (uses WHO)
8. B2B Elements               → Business perspective (uses WHO)
9. CliftonStrengths           → Organizational (uses all data)
10. Synthesis                 → Final recommendations
```

**Test**: Run Website Analysis on https://example.com

**Check**:
- [ ] Does it execute sequentially? (one step at a time)
- [ ] Or all at once? (batch processing)
- [ ] How many Gemini API calls?
- [ ] Are they one-at-a-time or simultaneous?

### 3. Report Rendering Test
- [ ] Results display after analysis
- [ ] All sections visible
- [ ] Export buttons present
- [ ] No 404 errors
- [ ] Can export as PDF
- [ ] Can export as Markdown

## 🔍 Issues to Investigate & Fix

### Issue 1: Gemini Call Pattern
**Question**: Does it make calls sequentially or all at once?

**Where to Check**:
- `src/lib/free-ai-analysis.ts`
- `src/lib/comprehensive-scraper.ts`
- API routes in `src/app/api/analyze/`

**Look for**:
```typescript
// GOOD (sequential):
const step1 = await analyzeGoldenCircle();  // Wait
const step2 = await analyzeElements();      // Then this
const step3 = await analyzeStrengths();     // Then this

// BAD (parallel):
Promise.all([
  analyzeGoldenCircle(),  // All start at once
  analyzeElements(),
  analyzeStrengths()
]);
```

### Issue 2: Report 404
**Known**: Server file storage doesn't work on Vercel

**Fix**: Remove `reportStorage.storeReport()` calls, use localStorage + export only

### Issue 3: Missing Analyzers
**Need to add**:
- Language Type Analyzer (value-centric vs benefit-centric)
- Brand Alignment Analyzer (stated vs shown)
