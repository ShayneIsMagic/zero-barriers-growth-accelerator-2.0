## Lighthouse Scores

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Performance** | **82/100** | ðŸŸ¡ Good (room for improvement) |
| **Accessibility** | **90/100** | ðŸŸ¢ Strong |
| **Best Practices** | **96/100** | ðŸŸ¢ Excellent |
| **SEO** | **100/100** | ðŸŸ¢ Perfect |

## 1. What These Scores Mean

Lighthouse scores range from 0 to 100, where higher is better. They provide a snapshot of the site's quality across four key areas:

| Category | Score | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | **82/100** | This is a **good** score, but indicates there are noticeable loading and runtime issues preventing it from being excellent. The key issues listed confirm this, showing substantial savings are possible for initial load time. |
| **Accessibility** | **90/100** | This is a **strong** score, meaning the site is largely usable by people with disabilities (e.g., screen readers, keyboard navigation). The remaining 10 points usually point to minor or manual checks needed. |
| **Best Practices** | **96/100** | This is an **excellent** score, meaning the site follows modern web development standards (e.g., uses HTTPS, has no deprecated APIs, avoids browser console errors). |
| **SEO** | **100/100** | This is a **perfect** score, indicating the site is well-structured and technically optimized for search engine crawlers to discover and understand its content. |

## 2. Priority Fixes

Priority fixes are those with the largest estimated time/data savings, directly improving the **Performance** score and the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

| Issue | Estimated Savings | Why It's a Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Improve image delivery** | **1,607 KiB** | This is the **most critical** issue. Reducing image size saves significant bandwidth, which is essential for mobile users or those on slower connections. It directly impacts page load time. |
| **Render blocking requests** | **470 ms** | **High Priority.** This refers to CSS or JavaScript files that prevent the browser from rendering any content until they are fully downloaded and processed. Eliminating them significantly speeds up the time-to-interactive. |
| **LCP request discovery** & **LCP breakdown** | **(No explicit savings)** | **High Priority.** **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** is the main metric for perceived load speed. These issues mean the browser is struggling to quickly identify and fetch the resource (usually an image or text block) that constitutes the main content of the page. Resolving the image and render-blocking issues will likely fix this. |

## 3. Quick Wins (< 1 hour)

These are issues that typically involve minor configuration changes or simple code adjustments.

| Issue | Estimated Savings | Fix/Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Font display** | **40 ms** | Use the CSS property `font-display: swap` for web fonts. This allows the browser to display system fonts immediately while the web font is loading, preventing a blank-text flash (Flash of Invisible Text or **FOIT**). |
| **Use efficient cache lifetimes** | **1 KiB** | Configure the server (e.g., via `.htaccess` or server headers) to set long `Cache-Control` headers for static assets (images, CSS, JS). This is a simple configuration change that ensures repeat visitors don't have to re-download these files. |

## 4. Impact on User Experience (UX)

The current set of issues primarily affects the **speed** and **reliability** of the initial page load, which is a foundational aspect of UX.

### Positive Impact (Accessibility & SEO):
* The **90/100 Accessibility** score means the site is largely available to a wider audience, including users relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation. This is a very strong foundation.
* The **100/100 SEO** score means the site is easily found by search engines, getting users to the content efficiently.

### Negative Impact (Performance):
* **Perceived Slowness:** The issues with **image delivery** and **render-blocking requests** directly delay the **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**. Users will experience a blank or incomplete screen for longer, leading to frustration and potential abandonment (especially on mobile).
* **Increased Data Usage:** The excessive image size (`1.6MB` savings) is a significant problem for users on capped data plans or slow networks. Users may hesitate to revisit a site that chews through their data.
* **Janky Loading:** The **Font display** issue can cause a "flash of unstyled text" or a sudden shift in content as the custom font loads, leading to a jarring or unprofessional look during the loading process.
* **Delayed Interactivity:** **3rd parties** and **Network dependency tree** issues suggest that third-party scripts (like analytics, ads, or social widgets) may be slowing down the main thread, making the page feel sluggish even after it *looks* loaded.

## ðŸ“‹ Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (< 1 hour):
1. âœ… Add `font-display: swap` to web fonts
2. âœ… Configure cache headers for static assets

### High Priority (< 1 week):
1. ðŸ”´ Optimize image delivery (compress/convert to WebP)
2. ðŸ”´ Eliminate render-blocking CSS/JS
3. ðŸ”´ Optimize LCP resource loading

### Performance Impact:
- Current LCP: Likely 2.5-3.5 seconds
- After fixes: Could be < 2.0 seconds
- User experience: Significantly faster perceived load time
