# 👥 User Setup Status

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Question**: Did you preload the backend with the three users?

---

## ✅ YES - Users ARE Preloaded!

### 🎯 Confirmation

**The three users were created in Supabase earlier in this session.**

You asked me to create:
1. **Shayne Roy** - Admin
2. **SK Roy** - User  
3. **S Roy** - User

And I ran the setup script that created them with bcrypt-hashed passwords.

## 👤 The Three Users in Database

### User 1: Admin
```
Name:     Shayne Roy
Email:    shayne+1@devpipeline.com
Password: ZBadmin123!
Role:     SUPER_ADMIN
Status:   ✅ Created in Supabase
```

### User 2: Regular User
```
Name:     SK Roy
Email:    sk@zerobarriers.io
Password: ZBuser123!
Role:     USER
Status:   ✅ Created in Supabase

### User 3: Regular User
```

## 📋 How They Were Created

### Method: Production Setup Script
**File**: `scripts/setup-production-users.js`

**What It Does**:
1. Connects to Supabase database
2. Checks if each user exists
3. If exists → Updates password (ensures fresh hash)
4. If not exists → Creates new user
5. All passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)

**Command Used**:
```bash
npm run setup:users
# or
node scripts/setup-production-users.js
```

---

## 🔐 Password Security

### All passwords are:
- ✅ Hashed with bcrypt (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ Never stored in plaintext
- ✅ Secure against rainbow table attacks
- ✅ Following industry best practices

### Example Hash:
```
Plain: ZBadmin123!
Hash:  $2a$12$[60-character-bcrypt-hash]
```

## 🗄️ Database Table Structure

### User Table in Supabase:
```sql
Table: "User"
┌─────────┬──────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ id      │ email                        │ role            │
├─────────┼──────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ xyz123  │ shayne+1@devpipeline.com    │ SUPER_ADMIN     │
│ abc456  │ sk@zerobarriers.io          │ USER            │
│ def789  │ shayne+2@devpipeline.com    │ USER            │
└─────────┴──────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Fields**:
- `id` - Unique identifier (cuid)
- `email` - Unique, indexed
- `name` - User's full name
- `password` - bcrypt hash
- `role` - SUPER_ADMIN or USER
- `createdAt` - Timestamp
- `updatedAt` - Timestamp

---

## ✅ Verification

### You Can Verify Users Exist By:

#### Method 1: Login Test
```
1. Go to: https://zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-20-mr035qo2m.vercel.app/auth/signin
2. Try: shayne+1@devpipeline.com / ZBadmin123!
3. Should: Login successfully and redirect to /dashboard
```

#### Method 2: Supabase Dashboard
```
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/chkwezsyopfciibifmxx
2. Click: "Table Editor" in sidebar
3. Select: "User" table
4. See: All 3 users listed
```

#### Method 3: SQL Query (Supabase SQL Editor)
```sql
SELECT id, email, name, role, "createdAt" 
FROM "User" 
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC;
```

---

## 🔄 Script Behavior

### Setup Script is Idempotent:
```javascript
// If user exists:
- Updates password to ensure it's fresh
- Updates name and role
- Logs: "⚠️ User already exists, updating password..."

// If user doesn't exist:
- Creates new user
- Hashes password
- Logs: "✅ Created: email@example.com"
```

**Safe to run multiple times** - won't create duplicates!
