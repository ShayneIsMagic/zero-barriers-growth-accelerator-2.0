# üîÑ Correct Analysis Sequence (Data-Driven Order)

## The Right Order Based on Data Dependencies

---

## Phase 1: RAW DATA COLLECTION (Foundation)
**Must happen FIRST - everything else depends on this**

### Step 1.1: Content Scraping
```
Input: Website URL
Output:
  - All text content
  - All images with alt text
  - All headings (H1-H6)
  - All links (internal/external)
  - All CTAs (buttons, forms)
  - Meta tags, title, description
  - Navigation structure
  - Testimonials
  - About/Mission content
```

**Why First**: You can't analyze what you don't have!

---

## Phase 2: TECHNICAL & SEARCH BASELINE
**Analyzes RAW metrics before interpretation**

### Step 2.1: Technical Performance (Lighthouse)
```
Input: Website URL
Output:
  - Performance score
  - Accessibility score
  - Best practices score
  - Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS, TBT)
```

### Step 2.2: SEO Technical (PageAudit)
```
Input: Scraped content
Output:
  - Meta tag optimization
  - Heading structure
  - Image optimization
  - Internal linking
  - Mobile responsiveness
```

### Step 2.3: Search & Trends (Google Trends)
```
Input: Extracted keywords from content
Output:
  - Trending keywords
  - Search volume patterns
  - Seasonal trends
  - Geographic interest
  - Competitor keywords
```

**Why Second**: Gives objective technical baseline before subjective analysis

---

## Phase 3: LANGUAGE & MESSAGING ANALYSIS
**Must happen BEFORE brand/framework analysis**

### Step 3.1: Language Style Analysis (NEW - CRITICAL)
```
Input: Scraped content text
Process:
  1. Count VALUE-CENTRIC language:
     - "helps you achieve..."
     - "enables your growth..."
     - "drives your success..."
     - Focus on customer OUTCOMES

  2. Count BENEFIT-CENTRIC language:
     - "has 50 features"
     - "includes X tools"
     - "provides Y functionality"
     - Focus on product FEATURES

Output:
  - Value-centric count: X
  - Benefit-centric count: Y
  - Ratio: X/(X+Y) = 0.35 (example)
  - Recommendation: "Shift 15% more to value-centric"
  - Examples to transform
```

**Why Third**: Must understand messaging style BEFORE analyzing brand alignment

---

## Phase 4: BRAND ALIGNMENT CHECK
**Requires language analysis to be complete**

### Step 4.1: Extract Stated Brand Elements
```
Input: About page, Mission statement, Values page content
Process:
  - Find explicit purpose statements
  - Extract stated values/pillars
  - Identify claimed differentiators

Output:
  - Stated Purpose: "We exist to..."
  - Stated Pillars: ["Innovation", "Quality", "Service"]
  - Stated Values: ["Integrity", "Excellence"]
```

### Step 4.2: Extract Demonstrated Brand Elements
```
Input: ALL website content (not just About page)
Process:
  - What does content ACTUALLY emphasize?
  - Which topics get most coverage?
  - What language patterns dominate?
  - What examples/case studies show?

Output:
  - Demonstrated Purpose: "Content shows focus on..."
  - Demonstrated Pillars: ["Actually emphasizes X", "Shows Y"]
  - Content priorities: [Topic A: 40%, Topic B: 30%, Topic C: 30%]
```

### Step 4.3: Gap Analysis
```
Input: Stated vs Demonstrated (from 4.1 and 4.2)
Process:
  - Compare stated to demonstrated
  - Calculate alignment score (0-10)
  - Identify missing content
  - Identify over-emphasized content

Output:
  - Alignment Score: 6.5/10
  - Gaps: ["Says 'Innovation' but no innovation examples"]
  - Over-emphasis: ["Too much on features, not enough on outcomes"]
  - Recommendations: ["Add 3 innovation case studies", "Convert 20% of benefit language to value language"]
```

**Why Fourth**: Needs language analysis complete to compare stated vs shown

---

## Phase 5: FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS (Building on Foundation)
**Uses all previous data**

### Step 5.1: Golden Circle + WHO
```
Input:
  - Brand purpose (from Phase 4)
  - Language analysis (from Phase 3)
  - Content (from Phase 1)

Process:
  WHY: Analyze stated AND demonstrated purpose
  HOW: Analyze unique approach from content
  WHAT: Catalog products/services
  WHO: Identify target audience (B2C AND B2B signals)

Output: Scores 0-10 for each, with both consumer and business perspective notes
```

**Why Fifth**: Needs brand baseline to properly assess WHY/HOW/WHAT/WHO

---

### Step 5.2: B2C Elements of Value
```
Input:
  - Golden Circle WHO (consumer signals)
  - Language that appeals to individuals
  - Consumer-focused content

Process:
  Analyze for 30 consumer elements:
  - Functional: saves time, reduces cost, simplifies
  - Emotional: reduces anxiety, provides hope
  - Life-changing: self-actualization
  - Social: self-transcendence

Output: Scores 0-10 for each element, consumer value map
```

**Why After Golden Circle**: WHO analysis tells us if content targets consumers

---

### Step 5.3: B2B Elements of Value
```
Input:
  - Golden Circle WHO (business signals)
  - Language that appeals to organizations
  - B2B-focused content

Process:
  Analyze for 40 business elements:
  - Table Stakes: meets specs, quality
  - Functional: revenue, cost, productivity
  - Ease of Business: time, effort, anxiety
  - Individual: career advancement
  - Inspirational: vision, social responsibility

Output: Scores 0-10 for each element, business value map
```

**Why After Golden Circle**: WHO analysis tells us if content targets businesses

---

### Step 5.4: CliftonStrengths
```
Input:
  - All previous analysis
  - Organizational language patterns
  - Content themes

Process:
  Identify 34 organizational strength themes:
  - Strategic Thinking: analytical, futuristic, ideation
  - Executing: achiever, discipline, focus
  - Influencing: activator, communication, command
  - Relationship: empathy, developer, positivity

Output: Domain scores, top 5 themes, appeals to both B2C and B2B
```

**Why After Elements**: Needs full understanding of what organization emphasizes

---

## Phase 6: SYNTHESIS & RECOMMENDATIONS
**Last - combines all perspectives**

### Step 6.1: Cross-Perspective Insights
```
Input: ALL previous analyses

Process:
  - Compare B2C vs B2B emphasis (are they balanced?)
  - Check Golden Circle alignment across perspectives
  - Verify CliftonStrengths support brand claims
  - Ensure SEO language matches value language
  - Validate brand stated = brand shown

Output:
  - Overall coherence score
  - Perspective misalignments
  - Integration opportunities
```

### Step 6.2: Prioritized Recommendations
```
Input: All gaps and opportunities

Process:
  - Immediate wins (Quick, high impact)
  - Short-term improvements (1-2 months)
  - Long-term strategic shifts (3-6 months)

Output:
  - Action plan with priorities
  - Expected impact for each
  - Resource requirements
```

## üöÄ Implementation Priority

### Now (Database Setup):
1. Create User & Analysis tables in Supabase (SQL above)
2. Create your 2 users
3. Test authentication

### Next (Add Missing Analysis):
1. Add Language Type Analyzer (value-centric vs benefit-centric)
2. Add Brand Alignment Analyzer (stated vs shown)
3. Update analysis sequence to follow correct order
4. Integrate into existing flow

### Then (QA & Polish):
1. Test complete analysis flow
2. Verify all perspectives captured
3. Check Gemini call efficiency
4. Simplify and optimize
