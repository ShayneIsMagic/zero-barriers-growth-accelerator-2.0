# 📊 Report Viewing Status

**Question**: Is the report in the app? Can I view it in the app?

---

## ❌ **NO - The Test Report is NOT in the App**

### Why Not?

**The API test I ran was external:**
```bash
# This was a direct API call (via curl)
curl -X POST /api/analyze/website
# Result: JSON data returned
# But: NOT saved to the app
```

**Where reports are stored:**
1. **localStorage** (browser-only) - Test didn't use browser
2. **Database** (if authenticated) - Test had no user logged in

**Result**: Test generated analysis, but it's not viewable in the app.
