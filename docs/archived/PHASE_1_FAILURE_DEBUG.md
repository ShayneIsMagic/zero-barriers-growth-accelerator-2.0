# üîç Phase 1 Failure - Debugging

**Date:** October 10, 2025, 11:35 PM
**Issue:** "Phase execution failed" for Phase 1

---

## ‚ùì QUESTIONS TO DIAGNOSE

1. What URL did you try to analyze?
2. What was the exact error message?
3. Did you see any error in the browser console?
4. How long did it run before failing?

---

## üîç COMMON PHASE 1 FAILURE CAUSES

### **1. Content Scraper Timeout**

**If:** Analysis runs for 30+ seconds then fails

**Cause:**

- Website too slow to load
- Puppeteer timeout
- Chrome-aws-lambda memory limit

**Fix:**

- Try a faster-loading website first
- Increase timeout in reliable-content-scraper

---

### **2. Missing Dependencies**

**If:** Fails immediately (< 5 seconds)

**Cause:**

- Puppeteer not installed
- chrome-aws-lambda missing
- Build issue on Vercel

**Fix:**

- Check Vercel build logs
- Verify packages in package.json

---

### **3. Vercel Function Timeout**

**If:** Fails after exactly 10 seconds

**Cause:**

- Vercel free tier has 10-second timeout
- Phase 1 might take longer

**Fix:**

- Add `export const maxDuration = 60;` to API route
- OR upgrade Vercel plan

---

### **4. Database Connection Issue**

**If:** Error mentions "database" or "Prisma"

**Cause:**

- DATABASE_URL not set
- Prisma client not generated
- Supabase connection issue

**Fix:**

- Verify DATABASE_URL in Vercel
- Check Supabase is accessible

---

## üß™ QUICK TEST

**Try these test URLs (known to work fast):**

1. **Simple site:** `https://example.com`
2. **Your own site:** `https://salesforceconsultants.io/`
3. **Static site:** `https://google.com`

**If these work:**

- The original URL might be the problem (too complex, too slow)

**If these also fail:**

- There's a code/dependency issue
- Need to check Vercel logs

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE DEBUG STEPS

### **1. Check Browser Console:**

```
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try Phase 1 again
4. Look for error messages
```

### **2. Check Network Tab:**

```
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try Phase 1 again
4. Look for failed API call
5. Click on it to see response
```

### **3. Check Vercel Logs:**

```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/shayne-roys-projects/zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-2.0
2. Click "Deployments"
3. Click latest deployment
4. Click "Functions"
5. Look for /api/analyze/phase errors
```

## ‚ö° POSSIBLE QUICK FIXES

### **Fix 1: Increase Timeout**

Add to `/api/analyze/phase/route.ts`:

```typescript
export const maxDuration = 60; // 60 seconds for Phase 1
```

### **Fix 2: Simplify Phase 1**

Remove complex scraping, use simple fetch:

```typescript
// Quick content extraction
const response = await fetch(url);
const html = await response.text();
```

### **Fix 3: Check Dependencies**

Verify in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "puppeteer": "latest",
  "chrome-aws-lambda": "latest"
}
```
