# üîç Vercel Deployment Issue

**Problem:** Vercel dashboard shows deployments from a day ago, not recent pushes

---

## ‚úÖ Verify GitHub Integration

### **Step 1: Check if Vercel is Connected to GitHub**

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/dashboard**

2. Click on your project: **zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-20**

3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Git**

4. Check:
   - **Connected Repository:** Should show `ShayneIsMagic/zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-2.0`
   - **Production Branch:** Should be `main`
   - **Auto-Deploy:** Should be enabled

**If disconnected:**

- Click "Connect Git Repository"
- Select your GitHub repo
- Choose `main` branch

---

### **Step 2: Check Recent Deployments**

1. In Vercel dashboard, click **Deployments** tab

2. Look for recent deployments (should show today's date)

**If last deployment is from yesterday:**

- GitHub ‚Üí Vercel connection is broken
- Need to reconnect or trigger manual deploy

---

### **Step 3: Trigger Manual Deployment**

If auto-deploy isn't working:

**Option A: Vercel CLI**

```bash
# From this project directory
vercel --prod
```

**Option B: Vercel Dashboard**

1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Select "Use existing build cache" or "Rebuild"

**Option C: GitHub**

1. Make a small change (e.g., add space to README)
2. Commit and push
3. Should trigger Vercel deployment

---

## üîß Quick Fix: Force Deploy Now

Run this command to deploy immediately:

```bash
cd /Users/shayneroy/zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-2.0
vercel --prod
```

This will:

1. Build your app locally
2. Deploy directly to Vercel production
3. Bypass GitHub integration
4. Show you the live URL when done

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

## üéØ Alternative: Check GitHub Webhooks

GitHub should notify Vercel on every push.

**To verify:**

1. Go to GitHub repo: https://github.com/ShayneIsMagic/zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-2.0

2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**

3. Look for Vercel webhook:
   - URL should be: `https://api.vercel.com/...`
   - Recent Deliveries should show today's pushes
   - Status should be green checkmarks

**If webhook is missing or failing:**

- Reconnect Vercel to GitHub
- Or use manual deploy (vercel CLI)

## ‚úÖ Verify Our Commits Are on GitHub

Our recent commits (last 2 hours):

```
0dbc0f5 - fix: Complete Supabase login SQL script
f96c4ef - docs: Working URLs and step-by-step testing guide
9892add - audit: Complete system audit report
fc2079a - feat: Phased analysis with manual phase control
```

**Check GitHub:**
https://github.com/ShayneIsMagic/zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-2.0/commits/main

You should see these commits at the top.

**If you see them on GitHub but not on Vercel:**
‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí Vercel connection is broken
‚Üí Use manual deploy (vercel CLI)

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED FIX

**Run this now:**

```bash
vercel --prod
```

**What it does:**

- Deploys immediately (bypasses GitHub webhook)
- Shows build progress
- Gives you live URL when done
- Takes 2-3 minutes

**Then test:**

```
https://zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-20.vercel.app/dashboard/phased-analysis
```

Should work immediately after deploy completes!
