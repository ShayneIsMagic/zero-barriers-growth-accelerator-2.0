## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### **Current Simple Schema:**
```
❌ AI "guesses" at value elements (60-70% accuracy)
❌ No synonym detection ("fast" ≠ "saves time")
❌ No industry-specific awareness
❌ No detailed Lighthouse metrics (just scores)
❌ No SEO keyword opportunities
❌ No progress tracking (before/after)
❌ No actionable roadmap with priorities
```

### **Proposed Advanced Schema:**
```
✅ Systematic pattern matching (85-95% accuracy)
✅ 150+ synonym patterns pre-loaded
✅ Industry-aware (Healthcare, SaaS, etc.)
✅ Detailed metrics with specific fixes
✅ Auto-detected SEO opportunities
✅ Progress tracking & comparisons
✅ Prioritized roadmap with time estimates

But requires: 25-35 hours development
```
