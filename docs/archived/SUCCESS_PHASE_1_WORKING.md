## ✅ LESSONS LEARNED

**What Worked:**

1. ✅ Testing live API directly with cURL
2. ✅ Reading actual error messages
3. ✅ Fixing root cause (not symptoms)
4. ✅ Verifying each component status
5. ✅ Clear SQL script for user to run

**What Didn't Work:**

1. ❌ Assuming "deployed" meant "working"
2. ❌ Not testing database schema sync
3. ❌ Claiming "complete" without verification

**Better Approach Going Forward:**

1. ✅ Test live API after every fix
2. ✅ Verify database schema matches Prisma
3. ✅ Don't claim "complete" without real test
4. ✅ Check all components (GitHub, Vercel, Prisma, Supabase)
