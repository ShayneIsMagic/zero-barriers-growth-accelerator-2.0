**Source**: [Simon Sinek's Golden Circle](https://simonsinek.com/golden-circle/)  
**Origin**: Simon Sinek - "Start With Why" (2009)

## üìä The Golden Circle Framework

A framework for communication and decision-making that explains how truly inspiring leaders and organizations think, act and communicate differently from everyone else.

---

## üîÑ **The Four Layers (WHY ‚Üí HOW ‚Üí WHAT ‚Üí WHO)**

### **Traditional Model**: 3 Circles (Why, How, What)

### **Enhanced Model**: 4 Circles (Why, How, What, Who) ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**

Adding "WHO" provides a more profound understanding of purpose and motivates stronger connections and loyalty.

---

## üí° **1. WHY - Core Purpose**

### **Official Definition** (Simon Sinek):

> "Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do what they do. When we ask WHY, we're not referring to making money‚Äîthat's a result. Your WHY is your purpose, cause, or belief. WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care about the work you do?"

### **Simon Sinek's Key Insight**:

> "People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it."

### **Official Example** (The Optimism Company):

> "The WHY of The Optimism Company is to inspire people to do the things that inspire them so that, together, each of us can change our world for the better."

### **Key Questions**:

- Why does our organization exist?

- What's our purpose, cause, or belief?
- What drives us beyond making money?

### **Synonyms & Alternative Terms**:

- Purpose
- Mission
- Core belief
- Driving force
- Raison d'√™tre
- Cause
- Passion
- Conviction
- Guiding principle
- North star

### **What to Look For**:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **2. HOW - Unique Process/Differentiator**

### **Official Definition** (Simon Sinek):

> "Companies and people know HOW they do what they do and can typically communicate these processes clearly. HOWs are often utilized to explain that a product or service is better than a competitor's‚Äîbut HOWs can be so much more than that.
>
> Our HOWs are the actions we take when we are at our natural best and are living out our WHY. It's HOW you bring your WHY to life that makes you and your company unique. As a result, the combination of your WHY and HOWs is like your organization's fingerprint."

### **Official Example** (The Optimism Company):

> "These are the HOWs of The Optimism Company: keep our offerings simple, adopt an infinite mindset, try to see things from unconventional perspectives, and always find the silver lining."

### **Key Questions**:

---

## üì¶ **3. WHAT - Products/Services**

### **Official Definition** (Simon Sinek):

> "Every single company and organization on the planet knows WHAT they do. This is true no matter how big or small, and no matter what industry. Everyone is easily able to describe the products or services a company provides or the job function they have within that system. WHATs are easy to identify and important to have, but are less impactful than the WHY."

### **Simon Sinek's Key Insight**:

> "WHAT you do serves as the tangible proof of your WHY."

### **Official Example** (The Optimism Company):

> "The WHATs of The Optimism Company are our classes, courses, keynotes, podcast episodes (and so much more) that encourage people to learn and grow their human skills of leadership, communication, and trust."

### **Why WHO Matters**:

**Emotional Connection**: Leading with "Why" creates an emotional connection, and understanding the "WHO" helps to deepen that connection by framing the purpose in terms of specific people and relationships.

**Sustainability**: An added "WHO" layer goes beyond just the "Why" to provide a more powerful and sustained motivation, especially in personal contexts or when facing challenges.

**Alignment**: It ensures that the organization's products and services ("What") truly align with the needs and beliefs of the people it aims to serve.

## üí° **Best Practices for Golden Circle Analysis**

### **DO**:

‚úÖ Start with finding the WHY - it's the hardest to identify  
‚úÖ Look for emotional language and belief statements  
‚úÖ Identify specific, named methodologies for HOW  
‚úÖ Quote exact text from the website  
‚úÖ Note the source location (hero, about, services, etc.)  
‚úÖ Look for alignment across all four circles  
‚úÖ Extract customer names and companies for WHO  
‚úÖ Identify cultural values and team identity

### **DON'T**:

‚ùå Confuse WHAT with WHY (products ‚â† purpose)  
‚ùå Accept generic mission statements as WHY  
‚ùå Overlook implicit HOW in values or culture  
‚ùå Ignore testimonials - they reveal the WHO  
‚ùå Score based on assumptions - only use evidence  
‚ùå Forget that WHO adds depth to the analysis

## üéì **The Power of the Golden Circle**

### **Why It Works**:

The Golden Circle taps into human biology and decision-making:

- **Limbic Brain** (WHY/HOW): Feelings, trust, loyalty, decision-making
- **Neocortex** (WHAT): Rational thought, language, analysis

**People make decisions emotionally (WHY) and justify them rationally (WHAT).**

### **Business Impact**:

Organizations that communicate from WHY:

- ‚úÖ Inspire loyalty, not just transactions
- ‚úÖ Attract customers who believe what they believe
- ‚úÖ Command premium pricing
- ‚úÖ Have engaged employees
- ‚úÖ Create brand advocates
- ‚úÖ Build lasting movements, not just companies
