# Golden Circle - Flat Fractional Scoring

## Framework Overview

**Framework:** Golden Circle (Simon Sinek)  
**Version:** 2.0 - Flat Scoring  
**Total Components:** 4 (WHY, HOW, WHAT, WHO)  
**Scoring:** 0.0 to 1.0 fractional (NO WEIGHTS - all components equal)

---

## Scoring Philosophy

**Every component counts equally.** No arbitrary weights. Simple averages throughout.

- Each component: Individual score 0.0-1.0
- Each component is scored across 6 dimensions
- Component score: Simple average of 6 dimension scores
- Overall score: Simple average of all 4 component scores

---

## Scoring Scale

- **0.8-1.0** - **Excellent** - Clear, compelling, inspirational
- **0.6-0.79** - **Good** - Well-defined and solid
- **0.4-0.59** - **Needs Work** - Unclear or generic
- **0.0-0.39** - **Poor** - Undefined, weak, or product-focused

## Example: Analyzing Patagonia

```
**Type:** Organization
**Name:** Patagonia

**WHO Score: 0.91** (Excellent)

**Overall Golden Circle Score: 0.91** (Excellent)
Average of (0.94 + 0.88 + 0.91 + 0.91) ÷ 4

**Analysis:**
Patagonia exemplifies Golden Circle excellence. All components score highly and align perfectly. They communicate from the inside out, leading with their environmental purpose. Their HOW (sustainable practices, activism, repair culture) directly supports their WHY. Their WHAT (high-quality, sustainable products) proves both WHY and HOW. Their WHO (environmental believers) creates a loyal movement, not just customers.
```

## Why Flat Scoring?

**Advantages:**
- **Balanced Evaluation**: All aspects of the Golden Circle matter equally
- **Clear Priorities**: See exactly which component needs work
- **Transparent**: No hidden assumptions about importance
- **Fair**: WHY isn't artificially weighted higher than WHAT
- **Comprehensive**: Forces equal attention to all components

**Philosophy:**
While Sinek emphasizes starting with WHY, all four components must be strong for the Golden Circle to work. A clear WHY with weak HOW won't differentiate. A strong WHY and HOW with poor WHAT won't deliver. All components must align and excel together.

---

## Interpretation Guide

**Overall Score:**
- **0.85+**: Exemplary Golden Circle, inspiration-driven
- **0.75-0.84**: Strong Golden Circle, clear purpose
- **0.65-0.74**: Good foundation, room for clarity
- **0.55-0.64**: Developing, significant work needed
- **Below 0.55**: Weak Golden Circle, likely outside-in communication

**Component Patterns:**
- High WHY + Low WHAT = Vision without execution
- Low WHY + High WHAT = Product-focused company
- High WHY + High HOW + High WHAT + Low WHO = Wrong audience
- Balanced high scores = Purpose-driven organization
