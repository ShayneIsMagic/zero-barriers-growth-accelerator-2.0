## Why Flat Scoring?

**Advantages:**
- **Equal Importance**: Every talent theme matters
- **Clear Priorities**: Easy to see which themes to develop
- **Honest Assessment**: Shows true talent distribution
- **Fair Comparison**: Teams can be compared objectively
- **Transparent**: No hidden assumptions about what's more valuable

**Philosophy:**
All 34 themes represent valuable talents. In different roles and contexts, different themes become critical. Your authentic talent profile should be represented honestly, not weighted based on someone's assumption of what matters more.

---

## Interpretation Guide

**Overall Score:**
- **0.70+**: Highly developed talents, strong self-awareness
- **0.60-0.69**: Solid talent base, good balance
- **0.50-0.59**: Moderate development, opportunities to grow
- **Below 0.50**: Many undeveloped themes (not necessarily bad - focus on top 10)

**Domain Balance:**
- **Concentrated (1-2 high domains)**: Deep specialist, partner for other domains
- **Balanced (3+ moderate domains)**: Versatile, can flex to different situations
- **Scattered**: May need to focus and develop signature strengths

**Key Principle:**
Don't try to develop all 34 themes. Focus on your top 10 and find partners/systems for your bottom themes.

**Analysis:**
- Strong in Relationship Building (0.67) - Team collaborates well
- Moderate in Executing (0.65) - Can get things done
