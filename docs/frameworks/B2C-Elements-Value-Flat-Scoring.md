- Tier 2 (Emotional): (0.6 + 0.5 + ... 10 scores) ÷ 10 = 0.62
- Tier 3 (Life-Changing): (0.4 + 0.3 + ... 5 scores) ÷ 5 = 0.45
- Tier 4 (Social Impact): 0.3 ÷ 1 = 0.30

**Overall = (0.8 + 0.7 + 0.9 + ... all 30 scores) ÷ 30 = 0.63**

## Why Flat Scoring?

**Advantages:**
- **Democratic**: Every element matters equally
- **Transparent**: Easy to understand calculations
- **Fair**: No arbitrary decisions about what's more important
- **Flexible**: Users can apply their own weights later if desired
- **Simple**: Straightforward arithmetic averages

**Philosophy:**
The market determines which elements matter most. Your scoring should be objective and comprehensive. If certain elements don't apply to your product, score them honestly (they might be 0.0-0.2). The overall score reflects total value delivery across all dimensions.

## Interpretation Guide

**Overall Score Meaning:**

- **0.80+**: Outstanding product delivering exceptional value across most elements
- **0.70-0.79**: Strong product with solid value delivery
- **0.60-0.69**: Good product but room for improvement
- **0.50-0.59**: Average product, significant gaps exist
- **Below 0.50**: Weak product, major value deficiencies

**Tier Analysis:**
- High functional + low emotional = Commodity risk
- High emotional + low functional = Experience issues
- High life-changing = Premium positioning potential
- Low social impact = Common for most products
