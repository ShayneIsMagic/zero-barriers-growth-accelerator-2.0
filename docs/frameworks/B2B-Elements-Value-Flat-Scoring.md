- **Transparent**: Easy to see exactly what drives the score
- **Fair**: Tier with more elements doesn't dominate
- **Actionable**: Clear priorities for improvement

**Philosophy:**
B2B buying decisions involve many stakeholders who value different things. Table Stakes elements (4) are as important as Ease of Doing Business (19). Every element represents a real business need. Let the scores speak for themselves.
