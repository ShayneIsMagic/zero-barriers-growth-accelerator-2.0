# ðŸ“Š Vercel Usage & Limits Check

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Concern:** Are we overloading Vercel free tier?

## ðŸŽ¯ VERCEL FREE TIER LIMITS

### **Hobby Plan (Free)**

| Resource | Limit | Our Usage | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Deployments** | Unlimited | ~20 today | âœ… Well within |
| **Build Time** | 6,000 min/month | ~30 min total | âœ… 0.5% used |
| **Bandwidth** | 100 GB/month | <1 GB | âœ… <1% used |
| **Function Duration** | 10 seconds | <5 sec avg | âœ… Good |
| **Function Invocations** | 100 GB-hours/month | ~0.01 GB-hours | âœ… <0.01% used |
| **Edge Requests** | Unlimited | Low | âœ… Good |
| **Projects** | Unlimited | 1 project | âœ… Good |

### **Conclusion:** âœ… **WELL WITHIN FREE TIER LIMITS**

**You're using:**
- ~0.5% of build time
- <1% of bandwidth
- <0.01% of function invocations

**You could deploy 100x more and still be fine!**

## ðŸ“ˆ BUILD ANALYSIS

### **Today's Activity:**

- **Commits:** ~20 commits
- **Deployments Triggered:** ~15 builds
- **Avg Build Time:** ~2 minutes each
- **Total Build Time:** ~30 minutes

### **Monthly Projection:**

If you deploy this much every day:
- 600 minutes build time/month
- Still only **10% of free tier** (6,000 min limit)

**Verdict:** âœ… **No problem at all!**

## ðŸ”§ OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### **If You Want to Reduce Builds:**

**Option 1: Batch Commits**
```bash
# Instead of:
git commit -m "fix 1" && git push
git commit -m "fix 2" && git push  # Triggers 2 builds

# Do this:
git commit -m "fix 1"
git commit -m "fix 2"
git push  # Triggers 1 build
```

**Option 2: Disable Auto-Deploy for Non-Main Branches**
- Vercel Settings â†’ Git â†’ Auto-Deploy
- Only deploy from `main` branch
- Feature branches don't trigger builds

**Option 3: Use `[skip ci]` in Commit Messages**
```bash
git commit -m "docs: Update README [skip ci]"
# Vercel skips this deploy (for doc-only changes)
```

## ðŸš¨ WHEN YOU'D HIT LIMITS

### **Scenarios That Would Exceed Free Tier:**

**Build Time (6,000 min/month):**
- If build takes >10 min each
- If you deploy 600+ times/month (20+ per day)
- If you have multiple heavy projects

**Bandwidth (100 GB/month):**
- If you serve large video files
- If you get 100,000+ page views
- If you have large assets (images >1MB each)

**Function Invocations (100 GB-hours):**
- If you run long-running serverless functions
- If you have millions of API calls
- If functions use >1GB memory

### **Your Current Usage:**

- âœ… Build: 2 min (fast)
- âœ… Assets: Small (mostly code)
- âœ… Functions: Quick (<5 sec)
- âœ… Traffic: Low (development phase)

**Result:** You'd need **100x more traffic** to hit limits!

## âœ… RECOMMENDATION

**Keep deploying freely!**

- Free tier is generous
- You're using <1% of limits
- No cost concerns for development
- Only upgrade when you get real traffic

**Monitor in Vercel Dashboard:**
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Click "Usage" tab
- See real-time usage stats

## ðŸ’° WHEN TO CONSIDER PRO PLAN

**Vercel Pro** ($20/month) gives you:
- 36,000 min build time (6x more)
- 1 TB bandwidth (10x more)
- Team collaboration
- Advanced analytics
- Password protection

**Only upgrade when:**
- You hit 80% of free tier limits
- You need team features
- You want analytics
- You launch to production with real users

**Current Status:** âœ… Free tier is perfect for now

---

**Bottom Line:** You're using ~0.5% of free tier. Deploy as much as you want! ðŸš€
