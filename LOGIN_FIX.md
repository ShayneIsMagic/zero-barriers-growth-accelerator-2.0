# üîß Login Issue - Two Problems Found

## Problem 1: Double Navbar ‚úÖ FIXING NOW

**Cause**: Landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) has its own header (lines 11-30) PLUS the root layout's `<Header />` component.

**Result**: Two sets of "Sign In" and "Get Started" buttons!

**Fix**: Removing the duplicate header from page.tsx (using only the layout header)

## Problem 2: Vercel Deployment Protection üö® CRITICAL

**What's happening**: Vercel has "Deployment Protection" turned ON, which is blocking public access to your site!

**This is WHY login doesn't work** - Vercel is asking for VERCEL authentication before even showing your app!

### What You're Seeing:
```
"Authentication Required" page with Vercel branding
```

### What You Should See:
```
Your actual sign-in form with email/password fields
```

## üîì Fix: Disable Vercel Deployment Protection

I've opened the settings page for you:
https://vercel.com/shayne-roys-projects/zero-barriers-growth-accelerator-2.0/settings/deployment-protection

### On That Page:

1. **Look for "Deployment Protection"** section

2. **You'll see options:**
   - Standard Protection (Vercel Authentication) ‚Üê Currently ON
   - Protection Bypass for Automation
   - Disabled ‚Üê CHOOSE THIS

3. **Select "Disabled"** or turn OFF the protection

4. **Click "Save"**

5. **Wait 30 seconds**

6. **Refresh your app**

### Then your actual login form will show!

## Why This Happened

Vercel enables deployment protection by default on Hobby plan to prevent:
- Unauthorized access
- Web scraping
- Bot traffic

**But it blocks YOUR users from accessing YOUR app!**

**For a public app, you need to disable it.**

---

## After Disabling:

Your app will be publicly accessible:
- ‚úÖ Homepage loads without Vercel auth
- ‚úÖ Sign-in page shows your actual login form
- ‚úÖ Users can login with: shayne+1@devpipeline.com / ZBadmin123!

---

**Go to that Vercel settings page and disable Deployment Protection, then refresh the site!** üöÄ
